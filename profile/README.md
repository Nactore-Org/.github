## About NACTORE

NACTORE is an initiative to contribute to the increasing dynamics of the world's largest democracy (India) and a way to contribute to AmritKaal 2047 by following the principles of openess. All the software suite at NACTORE will be open source, even the design documentations , pitch decks and everything will be open and transparent. The aim of this organization is not the become a profitable consulting to the government but to pitch ideas for opening new lines of distribution in the nation.

However, We are very open in thoughts to learn and maintain diplomacy with an open mind to learn and collaborate with other nations too. A specific reason to choose India is the availability of the largest social sector. Our Toolings will mature with time and could even serve as scalable solutions to the organizations across the sea.
